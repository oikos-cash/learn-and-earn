# Oikos User Guide

### A comprehensive user guide to decentralized finance

Welcome to the Oikos User Guide, a step-by-step tutorial detailing how to interact with key features and underlying concepts found in the [Oikos Network](https://oikos.cash/). Structured for both newcomers and seasoned users alike, this guide is meant to serve as a reference for key concepts within decentralized finance (DeFi), synthetic derivatives and other mechanics behind the Oikos Network and the industry at large.

### Breakdown
- Introduction
- Wallets
    - MetaMask

*And more to come! If you'd like to recommend additional features, reach out to our moderators on Telegram or Discord listed below.*

### Motivation

We initially sought out to identify strategies which could help reduce the onboarding friction for users entering the defi space. After some brainstorming with the team and members of our community, we understand a detailed walkthrough of user interactions with several aspects of the protocol will help 'demistify' the overall experience. 

This guide will also be the reference on how to interact with future features to be released on the Oikos Network.
