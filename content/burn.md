In order to unlock staked Oikos Network Tokens (OKS) users are required to pay back the debt incurred from generating synths. In order to pay back the debt users need to burn oUSD, which they can do from the 'Burn' tab on the [Oikos Minter](https://minter.oikos.cash/w). 

Within the 'Burn' tab, users are presented with the options of 'Burn Max' and 'Fix your Collateralization Ratio'.

### Introduction to Burning

*Alternatively, users can opt to manually input their desired oUSD amount.*

The 'Burn' tab will advise you how much oUSD you will need to burn in order to bring your collateralization ratio back to the platform target, to claim your rewards or to unlock a given amount of OKS. If you do not have any oUSD or enough oUSD, you will have to [purchase oUSD](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=0xbb4cdb9cbd36b01bd1cbaebf2de08d9173bc095c&outputCurrency=0x6bf2be9468314281cd28a94c35f967cafd388325) to burn so that you can claim your rewards or unlock OKS. 

### Maintaining your Collateralization Ratio

*Accounts must be on the target collateralization ratio*

Your account's collateralization ratio (C-Ratio) must be on the target collateralization ratio (500%), or else you will be locked out from claiming your fees and rewards. If your c-ratio falls to 200% then the account gets flagged for [liquidation](/liquidations).
